# Retro Against Humanity

![Retro Against Humanity](./retroagainsthumanity.png)

A fun, interactive statement generator inspired by Cards Against Humanity, specifically designed for agile retrospectives. 
This project is built using simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, allowing teams to generate "good", "bad", "improvement", and "star" statements for retrospective meetings with a click of a button.

This activity is inspired by the work of [Box UK](https://www.boxuk.com/insight/retros-against-humanity/).
